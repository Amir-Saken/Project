    <h1>COVID - 19</h1>
    <p>COVID-19, formerly coronavirus infection 2019-nCoV, is a potentially severe acute respiratory infection caused by the SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) coronavirus. It is a dangerous disease that can occur both in the form of an acute respiratory viral infection of a mild course, and in a severe form. The most common complication of the disease is viral pneumonia, which can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome and subsequent acute respiratory failure, in which oxygen therapy and respiratory   support are most often required. The most common symptoms of the disease include fever, fatigue, and a dry cough. In rare cases, infecting children and adolescents with the virus is suspected to lead to the development of an inflammatory syndrome.
   <br>
    The virus is spread by airborne droplets through inhalation of drops sprayed in the air when coughing, sneezing or talking with the virus, as well as through contact with the virus on the surface and then entering the eyes, nose or mouth. Effective prevention measures include frequent hand washing and respiratory hygiene. The disease is caused by a new virus, against which people initially have no acquired immunity, and people of all age categories are susceptible to infection.</p>

    <p>As of the end of February 2020, there is no evidence of the possibility of intrauterine infection or any complications after it in newborns if the mother is diagnosed with pneumonia in the third trimester of pregnancy. However, the samples from current studies are extremely small, and the national health Commission of China has recommended monitoring pregnant women, including after recovery, as well as isolating the baby from the sick mother after birth for at least 14 days.
    <br>
    In China, transmission is mainly in the family circle, hospital-based transmission in this country is not typical for infection.
    <br>
    There are reports of human transmission to domestic cats, tigers, and lions. It was experimentally found that the virus can be easily transmitted between domestic cats. The possibility of transmission from cats to humans requires further research.
    <br>
    Presumably, the virus is more effectively transmitted in dry and cold conditions, as well as in tropical ones with high absolute humidity. So far, there is only indirect evidence in favor of winter seasonality in the Northern hemisphere. However, analysis of correlations between meteorological parameters and the rate of infection in Chinese cities did not reveal a relationship between the rate of infection and the ambient temperature</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "img1"><p>Data on the duration and intensity of immunity against the SARS-CoV-2 virus are currently unavailable, and long-term serological studies of the immunity of recovered people will be required to determine the duration. Humoral immunity is formed against coronaviruses other than SARS-CoV-2, but cases of repeated infection (reinfection) are often reported. The RNA release of the virus decreases with the onset of recovery and may last for some time — from days to weeks, but this does not mean that there is a viable virus. During clinical recovery, IgM and IgG antibodies are produced, which means the development of immunity against infection. There are publications about cases of reinfection after a long period of time after the first infection, while confirmed cases of reinfection are rare.
    <br>
    Although SARS-CoV-2 has the ability to bypass innate immunity, it is assumed that a large number of mild and asymptomatic cases are due to the work of adaptive immunity due to previously transmitted diseases caused by cold coronaviruses circulating among the population. In 40% -60% of people who have not had COVID-19, cross-reactive CD4+ T cells are detected, which can provide partial immunity from COVID-19.</p>

    <h1>Symptoms</h1>
    <p>The most common symptoms are:
      <ul>
        <li>Fever — fever (from 83% to 99%)</li>
        <li>Cough (from 59 % to 82 %)</li>
        <li>Fatigue (from 44% to 70%)</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
    <p>Other symptoms include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Loss of appetite (40 % to 84 %)</li>
        <li>Shortness of breath (31% to 40%)</li>
        <li>Sputum (28% to 33%), muscle</li>
        <li>Pain (11% to 35%)</li>
      </ul>
</p>
<p>Less common are headache, confusion, runny nose, sore throat, hemoptysis (less than 10 %). According to a systematic review of manifestations, gastrointestinal symptoms of gastroenteritis were observed in about 15 % of patients, and about 10 % were not accompanied by respiratory symptoms, which led to a late diagnosis of the disease. There are also reports of changes in taste and smell in mild cases of the disease, usually these symptoms appear before respiratory, loss of taste and smell are also listed in the who list of symptoms. According to the who, rash and discoloration of the skin on the fingers and toes are also possible. Anosmia is less common than cough and fever, but it is not atypical for the disease and may be a significant sign for testing.</p>
<br>
<h1>Prevention</h1>
  <p>Currently, there are no recommended remedies that can prevent infection in the event of infection. Vaccine development is underway, and as of early September 2020, data on four candidate vaccines were published, one of which was developed in Russia. Three vaccines are adenovirus-vector, and one is an mRNA vaccine. However, before starting mass vaccination, all vaccines must be shown to be safe and effective in large-scale clinical trials.
<br>
The world health organization (who) has made General recommendations to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection:

    <img src="https://imag.one/storage/img/2020/10/20/1603201929_y1l.jpg" width="400px">
  <ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <li>Wash your hands regularly with soap or alcohol</li>
    <br>
    <li>When coughing or sneezing, cover your nose and mouth with a bent elbow or a disposable napkin, followed by mandatory hand washing</li>
    <br>
    <li>Keep a distance of 1 meter from other people in public places, especially if they have respiratory symptoms or fever</li>
    <br>
    <li>If possible, do not touch your nose, mouth, or eyes with your hands</li>
    <br>
    <li>If you have a fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, contact a medical facility for help</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
<p>Although under favorable conditions, the virus can remain viable for days on various surfaces, it is destroyed in less than a minute by conventional disinfectants such as sodium hypochlorite and hydrogen peroxide.
  <br> Alcohol consumption does not contribute to the destruction of the virus, does not provide disinfection of the mouth and pharynx, but has a devastating effect on the body's immune system. Alcohol consumption weakens it and reduces the body's defenses against infectious diseases.     Alcohol consumption is also a risk factor for developing acute respiratory distress syndrome.</p> </p>
