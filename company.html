Given the scale of the competition, it is difficult to understand why new sellers go there at all. However, this really makes sense, and it is thanks to the features of the algorithms on Amazon.
<br>
Amazon is known for its tough working conditions. The company uses a system of metrics, competitions between employees, and negative selection, which causes employees to "either go beyond their capabilities or burn out at work." </p>
